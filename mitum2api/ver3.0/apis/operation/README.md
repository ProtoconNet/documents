# Operation

Get information of the metadata and status of the operation. \
The response includes whether the operation worked normally and, if it failed, the cause of the failure.



In other words, even if the operation reaches the Metum node normally, if there is a problem with the internal operation, the operation will not be performed. \
In this case, it will be searched through an operation query.
