Create operation and broadcast.



Creating an operation in the Mitum protocol is similar to creating a raw transaction message.

In order for an operation to be executed and change the state of the network, it must be signed by the sender.

When a signed operation is broadcast to the network, it will be validated by the suffrage nodes, and valid operations will have their execution results included in the block.
