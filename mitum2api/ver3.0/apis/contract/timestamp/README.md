# Timestamp

Timestamp is a service that records the fact that a response has been made to a request in client-server communication.

It is important to note that it only records the fact that the communication occurred, but does not guarantee that the communication was successful.



This section describes how to retrieve the metadata of the Timestamp service and the information recorded in it.
