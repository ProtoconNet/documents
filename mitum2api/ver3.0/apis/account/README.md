# Account

Get the status of the account and the operation that the account sent.\


An account in the Mitum protocol is an address cryptographically computed from a private and public key.

The address of an account is activated by another account.

This means that the address computed from the private and public keys is not immediately available.



Therefore, the status can only be queried for activated addresses.



Mitum has two kind of account, normal (user) and contract accounts. \
Note that both account can be queried by address or publickey.
